Expected results based on current hard-coded values in the program. We'll
have to adapt as the definitions change.

One other thought: since the map (outside the core four worlds) is randomly
generated each session, it might help to have a scratch hex pad to mark up.
I especially want to verify map persistence, and world adjacency. The 
coordinates are very helpful for internal calculation, but a bit opaque
to look at and immediately understand.

Also, given the variable cargoes, and therefore non-deterministic amounts,
might be useful to have a ledger tracking changing status values. (Eventually
would like to have this feature built-in to the game as well...)

Throughout:
  * Status bar is yellow text on red background
  * Command messages (first line) are blue text on black background
  * Other text is standard white on black
  * A couple warning/failure messages in red/green as noted in tests
  * Data points do not change unless expected results note it

END OF SCRIPT ===========================================================

SCENARIO : MAP PERSISTENCE AND ADJACENCY ================================
Follow script above, or just fly around as desired, refuelling and 
recharging at every stop. Use a scratch map to record every world.
Ideally loop around to come at a an unvisited world from another direction,
then verify the connection when you get there (i.e. go out to Mithril,
then loop around to Aramis if possible. Predict Aramis shows up when you
execute the jump from an adjacent hex.)

Also go back an forth across the map and verify that the 'jump map' from
a given world remains the same the second time you visit it.

I ran this with the data produced from the first pass above, and it looks
good. Map data was persistent, and I was able to chart a course through
'unknown' space and connect to one of the three 'homeworlds' a couple times.
