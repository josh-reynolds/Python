# Trading procedure (Traveller 77 Book 2 pp. 42-4)
#
# Once per week, throw d66 to determine best cargo
#   DMs per world population
# Determine quantity
# Purchase if desired, up to limits of quantity
#   and available cargo space
# Partial purchases incur 1% fee
# Determine price of goods by 2d6 roll on table
#   DMs per skills, brokers, world characteristics
#
# Can sell cargo on a (different?) world
# Sale price by 2d6 roll on table
#   DMs per skills, brokers, world characteristics

# So overall sequence would be:
# Enter trade depot and see available goods
# Choice: wait a week, purchase some or all, jump to new system
# (And at any point can sell cargo in the hold)

# Other elements we will need:
#   time/calendar (so we will want to display current time...)
#   world characteristics
#   cargo tables
#   bank account (also need to display/query this...)
#   brokers for hire
#   character skills
#
# Not covered in this section, but eventually will want
# starship economics (Book 2 pp. 5-8)
# Operating expenses:
#   fuel
#   life support
#   routine maintenance
#   crew salaries
#   berthing costs
#   bank payment
#
# The starship economics section also covers freight
# shipping (flat rate - above is speculation) - add
# this option eventually. Also passengers.

# Ship design and customization is another potential
# area to explore. We'll assume a simple standard design
# (like the Free Trader) to start with.

# The star map will be a whole 'nother thing. A couple
# potential approaches:
#   Traveller subsector maps, whether generated or
#     loaded from a file
#   On-demand world generation - of course will need
#     to persist these systems as they are created

# UI thoughts:
#  as long as we're text-based, might want to play with
#  more ANSI code formatting to distinguish various things
#
#  also think about persistent display sections, rather than
#  always having to query data points
#
#  will need to make all the input much more robust - it needs
#  to handle bogus input appropriately

# -------------------------------------------------------------
# Comments about individual cargo unit_size assessment, prune
# through this and retain if any is useful...
# ---------------------------------------------------
# This data might belong in the cargo tables rather than here
# also, the RAW is very handwavy about tonnage for individual items,
# basically says "figure it out" - only some of these items
# are in the equipment list, so I'll fill in something plausible
# as best I can
# 
# Equipment list comparisons drawn from Book 3 (pp.16-7)
#
# Also need to consider that tonnage should be _displacement tons_
# not mass, so fiddle with the numbers supplied as necessary
# and there's packing material to consider too, as they call out in
# the example on Book 2 p. 43
#
# Per Traders & Gunboats p. 5, a 1.5m deck plan square, floor to
# ceiling, is half a displacement ton - so a 100-ton ship has
# 200 grid squares in theory. Yes, cargo hold ceilings might be
# higher than 3m, but this is a good enough basis for converting
# length/width into displacement numbers.
#
# Of course if we're dipping into sources later than the original
# three LBB, then we should be able to look all this up directly.
#
# Another observation - Traveller 77 trading setup does not consider
# Tech Level at all. Some of the items below might not be 
# producible on a given (low-tech) world. Can hand-wave by 
# assuming they are off-world products being warehoused here...
# 
# We'll assume the aircraft are less dense than the ground vehicles
# and fiddle with mass to volume ratios accordingly
#
# assume TL5 Fixed Wing Aircraft based on price
# weight 5 tons, cargo 5 tons, length 15m, wingspan 15m

# assume TL8 Air/Raft based on price
# weight 4 tons, cargo 4 tons
# the Scout/Courier deck plans in Traderes & Gunboats
# allocates 12 grid squares to its Air/Raft, so 6 d-tons

# not listed - base this on ship's computers
# closest fit is the Model/2bis, which costs a bit more
# (12MCr vs 10), and displaces 2 tons

# assume TL6 All Terrain Vehicle based on price
# weight 10 tons

# assume TL6 Armored Fighting Vehicle based on price
# weight 10 tons

# not listed, will need to guesstimate
# let's just assign it the same stats as ATV/AFV
# -------------------------------------------------------------

# -------------------------------------------------------------
# I'd like to ease the remaining coupling, don't like passing objects
# in to all the ctors, everything has access to everything. It's better
# than the previous global resource abuse, but could be better.
#
# The model I arrived at in Ship.refuel() may provide the way. It 
# handles its own data, then passes back the cost to the caller, which
# then passes it along to Financials. If we allow multi-dimensional
# costs (money, time, fuel, space), then the component classes could
# be properly ignorant of one another. Only the master Game class
# (which holds references to everything already) would know. This is
# something like a service bus - a blob of data flowing down a pipe,
# with individual components choosing whether to take action or not.
#
# Calendar (ImperialDate)
# ImperialDate
# Cargo (Credits)
# CargoDepot (Cargo, ImperialDate, Credits, Financials, Ship, StarSystem)
# Financials (Credits, ImperialDate, Ship, StarSystem)
# Credits
# Ship (Credits)
# StarSystem (Ship, Financials, CargoDepot)
#
# Should distinguish importing a class vs. calling methods or
# accessing fields on an existing object. The former is OK, the
# latter is coupling.
#
# The data classes (ImperialDate, Credits, Cargo) are fine, and
# right now Ship and StarSystem (with a minor exception) are in
# the same category. StarSystem owns CargoDepot - otherwise it
# is not coupled at all, so moving the latter up seems like a 
# good move.
#
# Almost all the logic outside of the master Game class is in
# CargoDepot, Financials, and Calendar. Those are the focus.
#
# So, after some initial shuffling, we now have:
#
# [OK] ImperialDate
# [OK] Calendar (ImperialDate)
# [OK] Cargo
# [  ] CargoDepot (Cargo, ImperialDate, Credits, Financials, Ship, StarSystem)
# [OK] Credits
# [  ] Financials (Credits, ImperialDate, Ship, StarSystem)
# [OK] Ship (Credits)
# [OK] StarSystem
#
# So, the model I think we're striving for is all actions involve
# invoking a series of sub-actions which return multi-dimensional
# costs, then passing the costs to the payees. Tempting to create
# a little class to represent costs, but that's overengineered at
# this point. Keep it to a simple tuple until we need more.
#
# Current actions:
#   quit
#   list commands
#   cargo hold contents
#   view world characteristics
#   wait a week
#   lift off to orbit
#   trade
#   refuel
#   go to jump point
#   land on surface
#   jump to new system
#   inbound to orbit
#   leave trade
#   show goods for sale
#   buy cargo
#   sell cargo
#
# There will of course be others, like skimming fuel, but these
# give a good sampling of what to expect. A few types:
#
# State transitions (quit, lift off, go to jump, land, jump, inbound, trade, leave)
#     Change state on object, may have a time cost
# Informational (list commands, hold contents, world chars., show goods)
#     Pull information from object
# Actions (wait, refuel, buy, sell)
#     Interact with objects, may have multiple costs
#
# These distinctions are pretty arbitrary, at least between the first
# and third. And in some ways even the second if you allow zero-cost as
# a thing. Anyway.
#
# So next step might be to make all actions (Command objects) correspond
# to a method on Game, and not allow them direct access to the child
# objects. Most pressing for buy/sell, but even the simple informationals
# should comply.
#
# Separating the child classes from interface actions (like print
# in the current UI paradigm) is also probably a good thing. They don't 
# need to know whether their output goes to the console or a
# GUI window. Be cautious of YAGNI of course. But still, if this is
# something like MVC, then the child objects are MODEL and shouldn't
# display anything at all.
#
# There are separate issues for the two classes still needing decoupling.
# CargoDepot is coupled in buy/sell cargo, which are both very long methods.
# Financials is coupled in notify and the tasks it calls.
#
# For the former, should break up the methods into small pieces (that
# still live in CargoDepot), then move the orchestration logic up to
# Game.
#
# For the latter, lift the observer up to Game - just add this logic in
# wait_week. At that point we only have one observer so the entire thing
# may not justify its existence, even though it isn't causing any problems
# in CargoDepot.
#
# OK. CargoDepot buy & sell have been broken up, and lifted into
# Game. This opens the door to removing references to Ship &
# Financials and fully decoupling the class. Methods of course will
# continue to slide around to appropriate homes as we go, but for now
# this is pretty clean. (I _do_ envision some sort of split of Game
# itself, possibly along MVC lines. We may end up pulling too many
# things up and that class will become bloated. One step at a time.)
# -------------------------------------------------------------

# -------------------------------------------------------------
# Another question is how to handle per-trip fuel costs.
# One model is to assess a cost for travel out to the
# jump point, and again for inbound. That does leave open
# the possibility of the ship being stranded.
# Alternative would be to assess the full trip cost on 
# landing.
# In both cases, there's the question of the player gaming
# the system and either evading costs or getting stuck.
#
# Could add a check before outbound to jump point that the ship
# has at least 2x cost (for there and back).
# -------------------------------------------------------------

# -------------------------------------------------------------
# We'll use the standard Imperial calendar, though that didn't
# yet exist in Traveller '77
# year is 365 consecutively numbered days
# date displayed as DDD-YYYY
# seven day weeks and four week months are used to refer to
# lengths of time, but rarely to establish dates
# (of course fun math, 7 * 4 * 12 = 336, so we are missing
# 29 days - but since week/month are really just durations
# it shouldn't matter)

# right now we only have refreshing the cargo depot weekly as an
# event, but there will be more:
#    * monthly loan payment
#    * annual maintenance
#    * monthly crew salaries
#    * daily berthing fees for extended stays
# other operational costs might better be handled as resource modeling:
#    * fuel
#    * life support

# also need to advance the calendar while in-system
# RAW says that ships typically take two trips per month:
# each jump is one week, and they spend a week buying & selling
# cargo, finding passengers, and on shore leave

# two approaches:
#    * give each action a cost in days
#    * advance the calendar only on jump and liftoff (the latter
#        perhaps with a message like 'you spent a week on Yorbund')

# for the former, does it add up to about a week? and do we want the
# player to be fiddling with time as well as money and space?
#    * to/from jump point - 1 day each
#    * to/from orbit - no time, don't want to privilege highport
#    * buy cargo (and load into ship) - 1 day
#    * sell cargo (and load into ship) - 1 day
#    * find passengers (and embark) - 1 day
#    * find freight (and load into ship) - 1 day
#    * listing hold/depot contents - no time
#    * refuelling - no time at port, 1 day to skim 
#    * recharging life support?
#    * financial transactions - no time
#
# easily 6-7 days if the player does all activities
# but if they want to go fast, jump in, skim fuel, jump out - just
# one day? or even no delay if they have reserve fuel.
# -------------------------------------------------------------

# -------------------------------------------------------------
# Will want to consider what aspects of the starport to bring into
# play. Fuel availability for sure, as well as maintenance
# availability. Need to mull over minor damage and whether other
# repair facilities should be accounted for. Bases? Probably easy
# to add, have no real play effect, just color (could influence
# ship encounters, but even those are mostly color at least in the
# initial version). Ship construction is also for some future 
# version, if ever.
#
# Interesting that starport has no impact on trade. You'd think
# that an E or X class at least has minimal to no cargo available.
# But let's not critique the system just yet. I'll fill in ambiguous
# areas as needed, but otherwise keep to RAW. Later maybe we'll
# explore other editions and/or homebrew our own trading rules.
# -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# ROADMAP
# Mulling over how to tackle ever-increasing TO_DO list.
# I think we can chunk the work into a few phases:
#  PHASE ONE <== we are here
#  * Full feature set for in-system speculative trading. Just a few
#    maintenance costs left to go.
#  * Basic travel & resources features.
#  * Refactoring. In the midst of a big push right now.
#  * (Should really take my medicine and get tests/pylint/etc. done)
#  PHASE TWO
#  * Jumping to a new system and all it implies:
#    * Multiple systems
#    * Star map
#    * Coordinate system
#  PHASE THREE
#  * Adding freight & passengers
#  * Any other remaining RAW procedures:
#    * crew, misjumps, etc.
#  PHASE FOUR
#  * Polishing game mechanisms:
#    * UI work
#    * Front end and menu
#    * Save/load if not done earlier
#    * Player customization: ship name, captain, etc.
#    * Save/load
#  PHASE FIVE
#    * Expand scope with RPG-lite elements and events
#    * Lift into graphics system? (This could really snowball, be cautious)
#    * Explore later Traveller versions for ideas (or to support as options)

#  # [    ] Unit tests for Ship
#  # [    ] Unit tests for StarSystem
#  # [    ] Unit tests for Game
#  # [    ] Unit tests for Command
#  * [    ] pylint/pydocstyle scrub
#  * [    ] Longer intervals need to make sure repeating events execute multiple times
#  * [    ] Advance calendar for in-system activities
#  * [    ] Add annual maintenance
#  * [    ] Add maintenance availability to StarSystem (A + B starports)
#  * [    ] Make type dunder methods more robust with NotImplemented etc.
#  * [    ] Review need for fraction credits ('cents')
#  PHASE TWO =======================================================
#  * [    ] Add multiple star systems and map (whether loaded or generated
#            and whether in advance or on the fly)
#  * [    ] Create a proper UWP class and generator in the StarSystem ctor
#  * [    ] Add select destination before jump (will tie in to subsector map,
#            world generation, possibly freight & passenger selection)
#  * [    ] Fix handling of observers after jump
#  PHASE THREE =====================================================
#  * [    ] Add freight shipping
#  * [    ] Add passengers
#  * [    ] Add unrefined fuel and its effects (and query of StarSystem)
#  * [    ] Add misjumps and other ship malfunctions (ties to unrefined fuel & maintenance)
#  * [    ] Add crew members with skills
#  * [    ] Add proper salary calculation per crew member
#  * [    ] Add survival odds for low berth passengers, and report results each trip
#  * [    ] Add low berth lottery
#  * [    ] Add shuttles to surface (esp. for unstreamlined ships)
#  PHASE FOUR ======================================================
#  * [    ] DESIGN ISSUE: single-letter commands are becoming too restrictive    
#  * [    ] DESIGN ISSUE: player can cancel and retry sale to get a better price
#  * [    ] Replace dummy/test data with 'real' values
#  * [    ] Shotgun surgery between starting commands and star system detail setting
#  * [    ] Move cargo data to separate data file
#  * [    ] Add visualization of cargo purchase DMs (colorized trade codes?)
#           (should be able to view in hold and while trading,
#            possibly also while choosing a destination world)
#  * [    ] Should we have a 'stranded' condition? Pay for a tow truck?
#  * [    ] Rather than having up-front tests, make some commands dynamically
#           available in command lists when conditions merit - e.g. only present
#           skimming as jump point command if the system has a gas giant
#  * [    ] Tie-in with game over and save/load game - add front end with
#  *         restart / new game options, including re-using same star map

#  * [    ] Add Navy/Scout bases to StarSystem? Only for color, yes?
#  * [    ] Should we allow partial fuel fillup?
#  * [    ] Ocean refuelling option if hydrographics permit it (should we then
#            split out another surface location? Implication of current 'surface' location
#            is it as the starport, which this is not. Scope creep, maybe hold this one
#            until phase five...
#  * [    ] Add extended StarSystem details
#  * [    ] Add different ship types and ship design
#  * [    ] Add a transaction ledger to Financial class
#  * [    ] Add loan history and statement (amortization schedule too?)
#  * [    ] Distinguish between highport and downport
#  * [    ] RPG lite elements: named crew, brokers, color events & encounters, etc.
#  * [    ] If we want to expand beyond just the trade model, add 
#            ship encounters (Book 2 p. 36), hijacking, piracy, etc.
