# Traveller map data
#
# This file must contain two sections: Subsectors, and Systems
#
# When transcribing from published data, subsectors must be assigned
# a cartesian coordinate. Designate one subsector as the origin (0,0),
# then assign the remainder coordinates according to their relative
# position.
#
# Subsectors should be listed one per line, with the name followed
# by the coordinate. Note that coordinate values increase down
# and to the right, so Traveller 'spinward'/'coreward' directions
# are negative values from the origin, and 'trailing'/'rimward'
# are positive values. The subsector at (-1,-1) is above and to
# the left of the origin (0,0) subsector.
#
# Systems should also be listed one per line in the following
# layout:
#
# Subsector Coordinate Name UWP GasGiant
#
# Bases, Travel Zones, Xboat Routes and Allegiance are not currently
# supported. There is no need to specify Trade Classifications - they
# will be calculated from the UWP.
#
# Note that the coordinate is the location within the 
# Subsector (between 0101 and 0810), not the Sector (between 0101
# and 3240).
#
# Also, entire subsectors should be listed - any coordinates not
# present below will be marked as empty space in the game.
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and ignored by the game.
# 
# Sample data below is from Supplement 3: The Spinward Marches
