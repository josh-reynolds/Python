Fifth and final project from 'Code the Classics Vol. 2' - a Pole Position clone named 'Leading Edge.' Mine will be called
'Racer.'

First pass through the book is complete, all stubs filled in and mostly sufficient placeholders for the 
thing to run. This one is the most complex yet. They are drawing the track with "2.5D" graphics rather
than just placing sprites and background images, so the update and draw code is much longer. Nothing 
too complex, but lots of code to type out. It also has some physics simulation, and frame rate handling,
so I will need to add the optional delta time handling to the engine.

Next step is filling in stubs from the book, then passing through one by one. There's a ton of graphics,
too, and making placeholders is getting tedious, so may drop those in. (I'm also getting exceptions from
the sound and music code since those files are missing too...)

----
Book scrub is complete. And I'm adding the resource files now. All that remains is scrubbing against
GitHub and playtest/debugging. And on the latter, we still need to implement delta time calculation
in the engine - the dummy value I am using now has the game running extremely fast.
