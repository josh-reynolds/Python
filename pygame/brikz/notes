Starting on Code the Classics Vol. 2. The first project is an Arkanoid clone they call
'Kinetix.' I'm calling mine 'Brikz.'

This will be based on v1.0 of my Pygame Zero clone engine, any changes required contributing
to v1.1. I'll follow the same methodology as the previous projects:

1) Starting from the bare minimum project (just stubs for draw() and update()), work bottom-up
   filling in one stub at a time.
2) Add new stubs and placeholder assets as necessary to keep it running without errors before 
   checkin. Add them in the same location relative to other definitions as in the book text.
3) Once done, again choose the stub furthest down the script and repeat.
4) One exception - when filling in a class stub, do the ctor first, then resume bottom-up.
5) Also apply fixes or extensions to the engine as necessary for compatibility as this progresses.
