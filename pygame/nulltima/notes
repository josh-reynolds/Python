Notes:
Just checked out Ultima III Exodus for a refresher; it has been many years. Might want to start with an even
simpler base - like Akallabeth or Ultima I - for an initial target, though the later games (and competing
series that came along after) provide an interesting roadmap for features. Some things are easier to do now,
and our expectations have changed in the forty-some years since the originals. But to keep this manageable,
stick with a very limited initial feature set.
