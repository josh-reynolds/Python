Notes:
Just checked out Ultima III Exodus for a refresher; it has been many years. Might want to start with an even
simpler base - like Akallabeth or Ultima I - for an initial target, though the later games (and competing
series that came along after) provide an interesting roadmap for features. Some things are easier to do now,
and our expectations have changed in the forty-some years since the originals. But to keep this manageable,
stick with a very limited initial feature set.

... tried out Akallabeth and Ultima I. The former is much more primitive than I remember, at least graphically 
(just abstract lines - I can see them on an Apple II greenscreen in my mind). The latter, though, is more
advanced than I recall. A huge step up. All of the core features above are present, except for the combat
mode. There's only one character involved, so combat occurs on the world map. But towns, wireframe dungeons, 
and so on are all there. This might be a good feature set to target. Take it in stages - get the overworld
working first.

Assumptions:
* grid is square
* grid dimensions are an odd number, so player can be centered
    * IIRC Ultima IV was 11x11, Ultima III was 13x13
* player remains at center - grid moves instead
* world data format is space-delimited integers, probably low range, but not necessarily single-digit
