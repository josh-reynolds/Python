Tackling the second project in Code the Classics Vol. 1: Cavern, a Bubble Bobble clone.

I implemented a working Pygame Zero-like engine module that is compatible with these projects
for the first project (Pawng!/Boing!). Very likely will need extension or fixes as we implement
this one.

First step is to get the framework in place:
    * engine.py present
    * game script, named main.py (engine expects this name)
    * sounds/music/images dirs

Goal is to exactly duplicate the book text, only removing the pgz import, version check and run
lines, and adding in references to my own engine module:
    * import classes at the top
    * import just the run function at the bottom and call it

I have a very minimal version set up - it runs, just showing a blank white screen. Now to get the
game working.

I see two ways to approach this:
    * type it up from top to bottom
    * start with the hooks invoked by the engine (update & draw), and fill in stubs as necessary
        to keep it running without errors

The first seems pretty boring, won't see any results until the whole thing is typed up, and then
will have to debug it as a whole. I think I'll give the second approach a go.
