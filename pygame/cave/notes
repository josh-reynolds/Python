Tackling the second project in Code the Classics Vol. 1: Cavern, a Bubble Bobble clone.

I implemented a working Pygame Zero-like engine module that is compatible with these projects
for the first project (Pawng!/Boing!). Very likely will need extension or fixes as we implement
this one.

First step is to get the framework in place:
    * engine.py present
    * game script, named main.py (engine expects this name)
    * sounds/music/images dirs

Goal is to exactly duplicate the book text, only removing the pgz import, version check and run
lines, and adding in references to my own engine module:
    * import classes at the top
    * import just the run function at the bottom and call it
