Starting on the fourth project from Code the Classics Vol. 1. This is a Centipede clone called
'Myriapod' - I'm going to call my version 'Bugz.'

This project will also produce v0.4 of my Pygame Zero clone engine.

Engine and main script in place, version incremented, and after running main.py, the starting
scaffolding is ready: an empty sounds directory, a __pycache__ directory filtered out in .gitignore,
WIDTH/HEIGHT/TITLE defined in main, along with stubs for update() and draw(). Project runs to a blank 
white screen - we're ready to go.

- - - -
The first pass is complete - all stubs filled in for State.MENU to be running without error. Very
minimal change needed to the engine so far, just a default parameter added to the Actor ctor.

Next step is to press space and push into State.PLAY, then deal with stubbery. After that, it's 
scrubbing against the test and GitHub, and debugging.
