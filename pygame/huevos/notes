This is the third project from Code the Classics Vol. 2. It's a clone of Dizzy they named Eggzy.
My version will be named 'Huevos.'

Version of the engine after this project will be v1.3. Skeleton is ready to go.

First stub pass is complete. Game does not look like much at this point. I don't have any
real resources. Both music and sound are throwing exception messages to the console, as 
expected. Also, I mocked up xml level data, which is all but empty - so lots of code hasn't 
yet lit up.

This game is considerably more complex than the previous projects, at least from a level
data perspective.

Rather than bring in all resources, maybe just one set of level data files to start with, then
deal with whatever code lights up. Then we'll scrub against the book, bring in resources, scrub
against GitHub, and playtest/debug as usual.
