Getting started on project 3 from Code the Classics Vol. 1. It's a Frogger clone named 'Infinite
Bunner.' I'm calling my version 'Run Rabbit Run.'

This will include any necessary changes to my Pygame Zero clone engine for version 0.3.

We're ready to go: v0.2 of the engine in place, version incremented, and the bare minimum scaffolding
set up. Project runs to a blank white screen.
