Getting started on project 3 from Code the Classics Vol. 1. It's a Frogger clone named 'Infinite
Bunner.' I'm calling my version 'Run Rabbit Run.'

This will include any necessary changes to my Pygame Zero clone engine for version 0.3.

We're ready to go: v0.2 of the engine in place, version incremented, and the bare minimum scaffolding
set up. Project runs to a blank white screen.

Going smoothly so far. I'm being even stricter about following the method this time through - starting
with the first two stubs (update & draw), only fill in new stubs as needed to get it to run. On the last
project I filled in things from the bottom up regardless.

I've had to add a couple minor things to the engine: making Keyboard subscriptable, and implementing a
basic Screen.draw_text(). The latter will need fleshing out; we'll get to that later. I also renamed
Screen.display to Screen.surface for compatibility - it was only being used internally in the class to
this point, so it was a trivial change.

Right now we have a white screen with a couple placeholder images for the menu, and a perpetually
scrolling background (from enabling the DEBUG settings).

There are blocks of code that haven't been triggered yet, so the interpreter hasn't had a chance
to complain (and force the corresponding stub work). The basic keyboard support is there, so once 
I finish the current skeleton, a key press will push it into State.PLAY and stubbing will start all
over.

First pass is complete. The game 'runs' on the menu screen with a continuously scrolling background - 
only placeholder images right now, so it doesn't look like much. And no sounds playing yet.

Second pass is to hit space and push into State.PLAY, then deal with that round of stubbery. Third pass
will be to walk the text and fill in anything I missed to that point. Besides the issues mentioned above,
there are some code blocks that only trigger rarely via RNG, so just luck whether I hit them before
pass three.

So far the engine has required very minimal changes, noted above.

Second pass is done. Still some big gaps missing from the text, and the game itself isn't much more
interesting. I'll be passing through the text now and adding what's missing. Then real resources,
debugging and hopefully done.
