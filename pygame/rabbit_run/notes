Getting started on project 3 from Code the Classics Vol. 1. It's a Frogger clone named 'Infinite
Bunner.' I'm calling my version 'Run Rabbit Run.'

This will include any necessary changes to my Pygame Zero clone engine for version 0.3.

We're ready to go: v0.2 of the engine in place, version incremented, and the bare minimum scaffolding
set up. Project runs to a blank white screen.

Going smoothly so far. I'm being even stricter about following the method this time through - starting
with the first two stubs (update & draw), only fill in new stubs as needed to get it to run. On the last
project I filled in things from the bottom up regardless.

I've had to add a couple minor things to the engine: making Keyboard subscriptable, and implementing a
basic Screen.draw_text(). The latter will need fleshing out; we'll get to that later. I also renamed
Screen.display to Screen.surface for compatibility - it was only being used internally in the class to
this point, so it was a trivial change.

Right now we have a white screen with a couple placeholder images for the menu, and a perpetually
scrolling background (from enabling the DEBUG settings).

There are blocks of code that haven't been triggered yet, so the interpreter hasn't had a chance
to complain (and force the corresponding stub work). The basic keyboard support is there, so once 
I finish the current skeleton, a key press will push it into State.PLAY and stubbing will start all
over.
