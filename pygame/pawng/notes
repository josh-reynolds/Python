 Converting Pygame Zero projects to 'raw' Pygame

 I'm working on NixOS, and there isn't a package available for Pygame Zero (and PIP
 doesn't play nice either), so I thought I'd try to backfill the missing pieces. Worst 
 case I should be able to pull pgz from GitHub, but giving this a go first. (Not 
 attempting to duplicate all of pgz - just enough to get the sample games working.)

 Overall it looks very similar to Processing. The client programmer writes a script
 with update() and draw() functions, and runs with pgz - that handles the game loop
 and event handling.

 I have coded up the first project from 'Code the Classics Vol. 1' and added a little
 game loop at the end. Goal is to hook these together - right now it runs without 
 errors, but only shows a blank window. I'll also need to download and/or create
 art and sound assets to get this working.

 Once the first project is converted, I should have a roadmap for doing the rest.

 Reviewing pgz docs for requirements:

 * pgz expects images in an 'images' subfolder (and AFAIK also assumes png format)
 * Actor class holds sprites, and has pos and height fields, and a draw() method
 * Additional fields: topright, left, right
 * pgz automatically calls script draw() and update() once per frame
 * pgz automatically calls event handlers if defined - on_mouse_down()
 * Actor class method: collidepoint()
 * pgz defines constants for mouse buttons and keys: mouse.LEFT
 * pgz expects audio files in a 'sounds' subfolder (format expected is wav?)
 * built in sounds module plays sound files by name (autoloads and creates wrapper objs?)
 * built in Clock can schedule func calls for later
 * Built in objects:
     * Screen - wraps pygame screen
     * Rect - directly from pygame
     * images / sounds - loads files on demand from images/sounds dirs
         * filenames lowercase/numbers/underscores only, start w/ letter
	 * .png/.gif/.jpg formats for images
	 * name passed to Actor is image file name (w/o extension)
	 * .wav/.ogg formats for audio
     * music - plays longer audio clips from music dir
         * plays one at a time
     * Clock - schedule function calls for later
     * Actor - holds moving images
         * constructed with an image name
	 * some fields: x, image, right, pos, etc.
	 * some methods: draw(),
	 * same fields/methods as Rect
	 * anchor field - by default center but can be moved
	 * angle field - rotate the image around anchor - also changes width & height
	 * distance_to() and angle_to() methods
    * keyboard - attributes matching every key, with True/False values
    * animate() built in function, returns an Animation instance
    * tone - generates tones w/ built-in synthesizer
 * event hooks:
    * draw()
    * update()
    * on_mouse_*()
    * on_key_*()
	 
--------------------------------------------------------------
step by step - Pawng!
* basic pygame.init and setting up display
* basic pygame game loop, and pgzrun.go() removed
* only event handlers for quitting game (window control and 'q')
* adding update() to game loop
* [comment out for now] adding draw() to game loop
* ISSUE: keyboard not defined
* create a simple keyboard class - need to add a couple boolean fields (space, down)
* loop is running, but can't yet respond to key events
* adding interaction between game loop and keyboard, and mechanism to reset between keypresses
* loop runs and can advance out of the menu state - still blank white screen
* next step - uncommenting draw() call - fails on screen.blit syntax
    pygame blit expects a surface, pgz wrapper screen can take an image name and autoload it
    need to create an image once that wrapper is running
* created a wrapper Screen class and started filling interface
* next error - 'Bat' object has no attribute 'draw' - need to fill in Actor, stub for now
* next error - missing another image, will fill these in as needed... just dummies for now
* OK, screen is drawing with some dummy images on white background, need to probe to see what's next...
    will switch from State.MENU to State.PLAY, but no visible activity
* in update for State.MENU, we now need to play sounds - will need another wrapper class
    created a very simple Sounds class that loads in audio files and exposes for playback, it works
* filling in Actor.draw() stub with very simple graphic to see what's happening next
    also having actors load their image in ctor
* tracing through calls now - three tricks:
    * add pygame.time.Clock().tick(1) to game loop to slow things waaaay down
    * add print statements at start of primary function/method calls 
    * add __repr__() to Actor classes
* D'oh, dumb typo stalling me out - no parentheses on call to obj.update !!
* OK, that got the basics working - ball moves, bats respond to key commands
* next error - fail to create an Impact when ball reaches bat - ah, missing parens again
    (I typed in the project code from the book, didn't download - apparently I added some typos)
* now hitting a bunch of missing errors, filling in with dummies...
* the AI is now successfully playing on the menu screen, until the ball goes out of bounds
* next error - 'Ball' object has not attribute 'pos' - Impact() when ball goes off top/bottom of screen
    adding the fix to Ball.update() - seems like pgz Actor was probably handling, but current
    code isn't calling super.update() either, so...
* [observation for later] - Game.play_sound() doesn't seem to get called, needs investigation...
