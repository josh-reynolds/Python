# The primary difference from text: Processing does not redraw the background 
# automatically, but the engine does, so we aren't getting trails drawn 
# on-screen - consider implementing similar functionality

# Processing also expects a setup() function to be run once at the start - I toyed with
# this idea in the engine, but the top-level code just above the call to run() is 
# equivalent. If I _do_ add such a thing back to the engine, would need to use some
# trickery to avoid having to add a dummy setup() to old projects - we want backward
# compatibility.

# Latest hurdle: Processing includes a noise() function to generate Perlin noise. I don't
# have the equivalent in Pygame or stock Python. I _could_ import a module, but I am
# contemplating rolling my own and sticking into the engine. Researching now.
