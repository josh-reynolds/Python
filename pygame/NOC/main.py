# The primary difference from text: Processing does not redraw the background 
# automatically, but the engine does, so we aren't getting trails drawn 
# on-screen - consider implementing similar functionality

# Processing also expects a setup() function to be run once at the start - I toyed with
# this idea in the engine, but the top-level code just above the call to run() is 
# equivalent. If I _do_ add such a thing back to the engine, would need to use some
# trickery to avoid having to add a dummy setup() to old projects - we want backward
# compatibility.

# Latest hurdle: Processing includes a noise() function to generate Perlin noise. I don't
# have the equivalent in Pygame or stock Python. I _could_ import a module, but I am
# contemplating rolling my own and sticking into the engine. Researching now.

# Perlin noise project is working, need to package it up and add to the engine...

# Moving ahead to Chapter 1 now. New issue: the engine can't access top-level primitive 
# variables - or at least it can't modify them. But if we wrap the values in a class, it
# works fine. I think this is a referencing problem due to the way the engine finds the
# content of this parent script, need to fiddlw with this to sort it out. But for now,
# going ahead with class-based solution, which is why Example 1.1 above looks a little
# different from the book version. (Update - declaring as global in the function may do
# the trick...)

# Another potential addition to the engine: mouse support...

# The Processing transform functions are also handy. Don't have a good equivalent in
# Pygame. Could do something like it by:
#  1) drawing everything to a separate surface, not directly on the screen
#  2) applying the current 'screen transform' - defaulting to identity
#  3) blit the transformed surface to the screen surface
# translate(), rotate() etc. would modify the screen transform
# and then we'd want to also support push_matrix() and pop_matrix()
# fairly big change to the engine, with potential to break backwards compat, so need
# to approach carefully and test everything thoroughly
