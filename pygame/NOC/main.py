# The primary difference from text: Processing does not redraw the background 
# automatically, but the engine does, so we aren't getting trails drawn 
# on-screen - consider implementing similar functionality

# Processing also expects a setup() function to be run once at the start - I toyed with
# this idea in the engine, but the top-level code just above the call to run() is 
# equivalent. If I _do_ add such a thing back to the engine, would need to use some
# trickery to avoid having to add a dummy setup() to old projects - we want backward
# compatibility.

# Latest hurdle: Processing includes a noise() function to generate Perlin noise. I don't
# have the equivalent in Pygame or stock Python. I _could_ import a module, but I am
# contemplating rolling my own and sticking into the engine. Researching now.

# Perlin noise project is working, need to package it up and add to the engine...

# Moving ahead to Chapter 1 now. New issue: the engine can't access top-level primitive 
# variables - or at least it can't modify them. But if we wrap the values in a class, it
# works fine. I think this is a referencing problem due to the way the engine finds the
# content of this parent script, need to fiddlw with this to sort it out. But for now,
# going ahead with class-based solution, which is why Example 1.1 above looks a little
# different from the book version. (Update - declaring as global in the function may do
# the trick...)

# Another potential addition to the engine: mouse support...

# The Processing transform functions are also handy. Don't have a good equivalent in
# Pygame. Could do something like it by:
#  1) drawing everything to a separate surface, not directly on the screen
#  2) applying the current 'screen transform' - defaulting to identity
#  3) blit the transformed surface to the screen surface
# translate(), rotate() etc. would modify the screen transform
# and then we'd want to also support push_matrix() and pop_matrix()
# fairly big change to the engine, with potential to break backwards compat, so need
# to approach carefully and test everything thoroughly

# Chapter 5 covers physics libraries. Apparently there _is_ a version of Box2D for pygame
# (pybox2d), and it seems to be available on NixOS according to the search page. But the 
# available versions are for Python 3.12 and 3.13, while I currently have 3.11. Some
# fiddling required. The story with toxiclibs is murkier. But a general search for 
# 'pygame physics libraries' turns up pymunk, so may give that one a go.

# In the meantime, I think I'll skip over Chapter 5 and revisit it later.

# Rotation was an issue again in the Fractal chapter (8). I implemented a rotate on my
# homegrown vector class, and a test class to verify everything is working OK. May still be
# some weirdness going on as compared to the Processing equivalent. Radians vs. degrees in
# the various function calls is easy to get crossed up. Behavior in all four quadrants, 
# rotational direction, and going past 360 degrees are all consderations too. But this is
# working well enough to get the Koch curve implemented.

# I've been able to survive without push/popmatrix so far, but the next section on Fractal
# Trees makes heavy use of it. Will need to think about an approach. As noted above, the
# long-term solution is probably to integrate this deeply into the engine, but that's more
# work than warranted just yet. But maybe a tiny class that wraps calls to screen.draw could
# give the desired behavior.

# What if screen retains the matrix settings? So you'd call screen.translate(), screen.rotate(),
# etc. It would maintain a transform matrix, which may be enough on its own. Translate by itself
# could be handled just by an 'origin' field, which by default is set to the top-left of the
# window (0,0).

# Additional hurdle to add into this one: the transform calls should be relative/accumulative,
# but the current model has us calling repeatedly in draw() - and we need to do that because
# otherwise the first draw() out of the run() loop will clear the screen. So... I'm adding
# back the setup() function with a hook in the main loop (I previously called this 'once()'). As
# noted above, we'll need to do something dynamic to preserve backward compatibility (i.e. don't
# barf if the main script does not have a setup() function.

# I also needed to suppress the auto-fill behavior in the main loop, via an optional flag to
# run(). This is a bit klunky right now, needs lots of smoothing before we can bring it back
# to the main engine project. But this is a good sandbox for figuring it all out.
