Beginning the second project in Code the Classics Vol. 2. This is a Defender clone they call
Avenger, so in keeping with the super-team theme, mine will be 'Invader.'

This is going to contribute to v1.2 of the pgz clone engine. Same approach as before, initial
stub skeleton is ready to go.

First pass is complete. Next steps are bringing in the official resources, scrubbing against the book
and GitHub, and playtest/debugging.

Interesting - unlike every previous project, this one omits the Python & Pygame Zero version checks, at
least in the book text. I'm bringing it in anyway.
