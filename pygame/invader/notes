Beginning the second project in Code the Classics Vol. 2. This is a Defender clone they call
Avenger, so in keeping with the super-team theme, mine will be 'Invader.'

This is going to contribute to v1.2 of the pgz clone engine. Same approach as before, initial
stub skeleton is ready to go.

First pass is complete. Next steps are bringing in the official resources, scrubbing against the book
and GitHub, and playtest/debugging.

Interesting - unlike every previous project, this one omits the Python & Pygame Zero version checks, at
least in the book text. I'm bringing it in anyway.

-----
Book scrub is complete, and the official resources are in place. Before checking out GitHub, I'm 
trying some playtesting - with placeholder graphics it was pretty meager, and only caught syntax
errors and broken functionality. Now that I can see what's going on, more subtle issues are uncovered.

* [FIXED] warning at start: libpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
* [     ] enemies don't move
* [     ] on laser hit, enemy explosion is not displayed, sprite stays on-screen (sound effect does play)
* [     ] enemies do not fire any bullets (just landers at start, do they shoot?)
* [     ] music does not play at all, menu or in game
* [     ] after seemingly killing all enemies, wave does not end

There's a good discussion on StackOverflow (22745076) about the first issue, and how to fix it. Some of the PNG
files contain chunks that the graphics library in Pygame (I think) is unhappy about, and it is 
spewing a warning. Fix is to remove those chunks.

You can identify the files with pngcrush (search to find and download it), and fix with mogrify (part of
the ImageMagick suite).

find . -name '*.png' -exec sh -c 'pngcrush -n -q {} 2>&1 | grep "known incorrect sRGB"' \; -print

11 files are affected (output from previous command):

pngcrush: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
./images/bolt1.png
pngcrush: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
./images/newgame5.png
pngcrush: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
./images/newgame0.png
pngcrush: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
./images/bullet0.png
pngcrush: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
./images/bullet1.png
pngcrush: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
./images/newgame6.png
pngcrush: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
./images/newgame1.png
pngcrush: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
./images/newgame2.png
pngcrush: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
./images/bolt0.png
pngcrush: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
./images/newgame4.png
pngcrush: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
./images/newgame3.png

List is out of order, but it looks like every newgame*, bolt* and bullet* image is affected. That seems
plausible, like it aligns with some artist's workflow, rather than randomly affecting files across the 
full set.

The fix is as simple as:

for i in ./images/newgame*; do mogrify $i; done
for i in ./images/bolt*; do mogrify $i; done
for i in ./images/bullet*; do mogrify $i; done

This is done, and on running the game the errors are gone.
